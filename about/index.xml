      <description>&amp;#34;Life is Complex. It has Real and Imaginary parts.&#34;   <b>News: I'm joining Microsoft Bing as a SWE next month!</b> <br><br>Hi, I’m Swastik, but you’ll often find me as justanotherlad on the Internet. I have been working as the Search Engineer at Wolfram Research since 2021 where my work is focused on improving Search Relevance, Ranking and building transformer based models for Search for the documentation of Mathematica(software) and other wolfram org. websites in collaboration with the Web and core ML team; prior to this I was a Summer Researcher followed by an Intern at Wolfram. I also worked briefly with IBM Research as a Project Assistant in Applied Cryptography, on Differential Privacy and Multi-Party Computation. I have completed my undergraduation in Computer Science, with major in Information Technology.
My primary interests are Information Retrieval, Conversational systems, Applied Cryptography, Discrete Mathematics and Music-making.
I&rsquo;m also trying to explore other areas of computer science and cyber-security.</description>
