      <description>&amp;#34;Life is Complex. It has Real and Imaginary parts.&amp;#34;   Hi, I’m Swastik, but you’ll often find me as justanotherlad on the Internet. I have been working as a full-time Software Developer at Wolfram Research since 2021. I have completed my undergraduation in Computer Science, with major in Information Technology.
My primary interests are Algorithms, Cryptography, Discrete Maths and Music-making.
I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to explore other areas of computer science and security.</description>
