      <description>&amp;#34;Life is Complex. It has Real and Imaginary parts.&#34; Hi, I’m Swastik, but you’ll often find me as justanotherlad on the Internet. I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft AI (Bing/Copilot Search) based in Hyderabad, India. Before this, I was working remotely as the Lead Search Engineer for Wolfram Research. In my last 4 years in the industry, I have worked on developing and maintaining high-QPS and low-latency (backend) systems handling Search Relevance, Ranking, e2e RAG systems (hybrid search, i.e., lexical + semantic search using dense retrieval/vector-embeddings + sparse/BM25 mechanisms) and maximizing user experience & engagement by handling the UX/Frontend of bing.com (People Also Ask answer) and search.wolfram.com websites; I started-off in the industry as a Summer Researcher followed by a 9-month long Internish at Wolfram, where I worked on several R&D projects related to symbolic computation & computer algebraic systems. Somewhere in the middle I was also associated with IBM Research India as a Part-time Research Assistant under Staff Research Scientist of IBM Quantum + AI Innovation dept., Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy, where I worked on some Applied Cryptography projects, particularly on Differential Privacy and Multi-Party Computation. I have completed my undergraduation in Computer Science, with major in Information Technology.
My primary interests are Information Retrieval, Conversational systems, Applied Cryptography, Discrete Mathematics and Music-making.
I&rsquo;m also trying to explore other areas of computer science and cyber-security.</description>
