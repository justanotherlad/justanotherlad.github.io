      <description>&amp;#34;Life is Complex. It has Real and Imaginary parts.&amp;#34;   Hi, I’m Swastik, but you’ll often find me as justanotherlad on the Internet. I’m a Computer Science undergraduate currently, majoring in Information Technology.
My primary interests are Algorithms, Cryptography, Discrete Maths and Music-making.
I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to explore other areas of computer science and security, and I aim to pursue some kind of research in Theoretical CS in my future (phew,let&amp;rsquo;s see).</description>
